In this section, let us explore the concepts of cloud native framework and programming models that are used for building cloud applications.

== Cloud Native Application Framework

https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md#cncf-cloud-native-definition-v10[CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0]

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.

The basic components of any cloud native architecture are

- Microservices
- DevOps
- Continuous Delivery
- Containers

=== Microservices

Microservices are small applications which are lightweight. This is an architectural style in which the application is a group of services.

- They are loosely coupled.
- They communicate with each other via application programming interfaces (APIs).

=== DevOps

Devops is a practice of bringing development and operations engineers closer to work in a more collaborative manner. The goal is to make them work together along the entire software development lifecycle beginning from design to development till production.

- It is more a culture.
- Utilizes the technology particularly automation tools.

This helps to

- Move faster leading to shorter development cycles.
- Build high quality software.
- Reduce bugs.
- Reduce the delivery cost.

For more details, refer `DevOps Concepts` concept in the further modules.

=== Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is one of the most important practices in DevOps. If you are adopting DevOps, then Continuous Delivery is a must.

In this process, any changes you made to the code will be automatically built, tested and prepared for a release to production. This is done with the help of an automated software production line called Continuous Delivery pipeline.

Typically, a delivery pipeline will have the below stages. The stages may vary based on your requirements.

- Build Automation
- Test Automation
- Deployment Automation

For more details, refer `CI/CD` concept in the further modules.

=== Containers

Containers are a standard way to package an application and all its dependencies so that it can be moved between environments and run without change.

They allow us to

- Increase portability and efficiency.
- Reduces overhead.
- Increases speed.
- Easy deployments.

For more details, go through the `Containerization` concept in the further module.

== Framework & Programming Model

For building a cloud native application, it is good to have a programming model. You can build a programming model from scratch or you can use the experience from existing models. Using the current technologies and new concepts, below is one of the models.

=== Best of breed languages and frameworks

Cloud-native application is a combination of many microservices. These microservices are written in different languages. Developers pick different frameworks based on the programming language.

Cloud-native applications are polyglot. Based on the functionality of the individual services, you can pick different runtimes and different language frameworks.

For instance, you can write the user interface of your application using Node.js and choose to write the APIs in Java using MicroProfile.

There are many languages and their relative frameworks available. Some of them are as follows.

- If you are an Enterprise Java developer and planning to use Java, you can opt https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile framework].
- If you prefer Spring, you can opt https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot].
- If you prefer Node.js, you can opt https://expressjs.com/[Express.js] or https://loopback.io/[LoopBack].
- If you are Swift developer, you can opt https://www.kitura.io/[Kitura].

=== Container Orchestration

Container Orchestration is nothing but managing the lifecycles of the containers. This automates several aspects like the following to manage containers.

- Provisioning
- Deployment
- Availability
- Resource Allocation
- Load balancing
- Monitoring health
- Config Management

Among the different container orchestration tools, Kubernetes is one of the most popular ones.

=== Service Mesh

Service Mesh mediates all the communication between services. It offers things like service discovery, monitoring, security, scalability, and high availability. It also deals with other things like A/B testing, canary rollouts, load balancing, rate limiting etc.

Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole, offering a complete solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications.

=== Programming Model

All these great new technologies and concepts can be used to design a well grooved path for doing software engineering. The programming model above helps the developers to get started with their cloudnative journey without constructing everything from scratch.

- The latest frameworks and languages offer many of these capabilities. They cover features like configurations, JSON handling, tracing, metrics, REST APIs, API documentation, security, health checks, fault tolerance, etc.
- Also container orchestration helps to achieve some of these by offering Config Management, health monitoring etc.
- Service Mesh like Istio provides capabilities which covers tracing, fault tolerance, security and traffic management.
