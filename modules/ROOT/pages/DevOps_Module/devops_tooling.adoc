== Introduction

DevOps is a software development and delivery process. It provides frameworks using several open source tools available to manage different phases of the application life cycle. It also ensures that all of them work together as a single cohesive unit.

Today across the industry, there are some best practices for DevOps. They include Source Code Management, Code Review, Configuration Management, Build Management, Artifact Repository Management, Release Management, Test Automation, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Infrastructure As Code, Automation, Key Application Performance Monitoring/Indicators.

In order to implement all of them, we need appropriate tools. In this section, let us explore what are the different tools available and how these tools can be used to maintain and improve the aspects of DevOps.

== Source Code Management Tools
